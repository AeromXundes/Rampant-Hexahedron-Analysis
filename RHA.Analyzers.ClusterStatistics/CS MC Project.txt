Algorithm
	Get data.
	Separate into different IDs.
		Can select only one ID for further analysis, or analyze all of them.
		Each unique ID and data value pair is separated.
	If needed, combine select ID:Data pairs.
	Now we have just the blocks we are interested in, we should analyze now.

Cluster detection
	Start with a single block, add it to a new cluster object.
	Find all blocks that are within 1 block of each other, including diagonal distance.
		Similar to MST
		This will not separate the clusters that overlapped.

Cluster analysis
	stats:
		Blocks per cluster
		clusters per chunk
		blocks per chunk (general stat, tho)
		location of clusters
			horizontal
			vertical
			both global and chunk-wise.
		length/width/height of clusters
		shape of clusters:
			for all clusters with longer in a particular direction, this what we found on average (show graph)
				this might break for diagonal clusters
	per biome
	
Stuff this project might find useful:
	Locality-sensitive hashing
	Nearest neighbor search

Further development:
	for the mod Custom Ore Generation, the OPTICS alg would make for a perfect fit.
