Cluster Statistics
An addin library for Rampant Hexahedron Analysis (RHA)
By Aerom Xundes

Part of a programming project for CS-1332 at Georgia Tech during the Fall 2013 Semester.

Brief description:
	Provides a suite to analyze clusters of blocks. Intended for ore blocks, but can be used with any block id.
	
	* Statistics across all clusters in a game world.
		* Perfect for mod developers tuning a mod's ore generation, or server admins wanting a bit extra ore for their players without giving too much extra.
	* Gives empirical data on clusters.
		* No more guess-work when trying to figure out how much ore is enough.
		* You don't have to play for hours to establish how much ore you need. Generate a world and analyze!


	Limitations of this analyzer:
		Clusters are defined as a single continuous volume of blocks touching each other (horizonally, vertically, and diagonally).
		Meaning this analyzer will not give reliable results with density based ore generation (such as a cloud of ore).
		There is no way for this analyzer to determine when two clusters are generated together---it will assume it is one large cluster.
			Although, the statistics will likely flag these larger clusters as outliers.
